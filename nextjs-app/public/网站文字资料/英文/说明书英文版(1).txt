"Principle: Due to its excellent physicochemical properties, the electrolytic ceramic diaphragm is not corroded in the plating solution. This process uses electrolysis to transport impurity cations through the capillary pores of the ceramic diaphragm into the ceramic diaphragm barrel (cathode area), achieving the purpose of removal. As the acid liquid inside the barrel changes from clear to increasingly concentrated, it indicates that impurities in the chromium solution have been collected inside the barrel. Simultaneously, trivalent chromium in the chromium solution or roughening liquid is oxidized to hexavalent chromium at the anode through electrolysis for recycling, while the impurity ions at the cathode are retained within the ceramic diaphragm and removed, thus purifying the roughening liquid and chrome plating solution."	原理：由于具有优异的物理化学性能，电解陶瓷隔膜在镀液中不会被腐蚀。本工艺是利用电解作用， 将杂质阳离子经由陶瓷隔膜毛细孔进入陶瓷隔膜筒内（阴极区），从而达到除去的目的。因此当筒内之酸液色泽由清变为愈来愈浓，即表示铬液中的不纯物已经被收集在筒内，同时铬液或粗化液中之三价铬，亦经过电解作用，在阳极被氧化为六价铬得以循环利用，阴极的杂质离子留在陶瓷隔膜内、去除，从而实现了粗化液和镀铬液的净化
"Operating Instructions: Prior to use, the bisque barrel should be filled with or immersed in pure water for more than 30 minutes, and thoroughly wiped inside and out with a soft cloth. Secure the bisque barrel to the pole using plastic rope or insulated wire through the two holes at its upper end, and position it on the cathode pole with a copper plate. Load the barrel with a pale brown electrolytic solution (chromic acid at 50g/L and sulfuric acid at 10g/L). The ratio of anode to cathode surface area is 2:1. Set the voltage between 4-10V, maintain a temperature of 50°C, and run for a minimum of 3 hours. Post-electrolysis, first remove the electrode plate from within the barrel, then remove the barrel from the tank. Inspect the electrolyte, which should appear dark brown or slightly thick, and then transfer it to a chromium waste treatment tank or undergo separate detoxification."
